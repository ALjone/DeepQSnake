To do:

LIVE PLOTTING, WITH DISTRIBUTION OF APPLES

Rewrite checkpoints to just save a the model of a training session along with its hyperparameter file (pickle?)
Comment and clean up code
Try different hyperparams such as batch size
Try even deeper architectures + different things like batch norm and max pooling perhaps.
Fix plotting and other statistics (std maybe)
Some games no random moves, some games higher rate of random moves, or only do random moves after x moves in a game
Second best move sometimes, rather than random move
Make multi-agent setup
Try same setup with different games
Better graphics engine
Input to linear layers that says something about whether or not that state has already been visited

Saves the plots
