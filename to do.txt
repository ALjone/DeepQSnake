To do:

Attempt distributed agents
Rewrite game to C/C++/Java/Rust/Whatever
Do more research on loss function for dueling heads, and general network architecture
Research better exploring method than epsilon-greedy (Preferably one that simply gets better the longer you train without human intereference)
Make a custom noisy layer for noisy-nets
Make website that visualizes the best model
Frame stacking is necessary
